# Rhythm-Game
This is a project that I have created in College. I have created a rhythm game that included many steps and designs before the final product was finished. This game included outlining the project of what I wanted to create and also laying out the key requirements that the game must have, and I have included stakeholders to test and review the functionalities and usabilities of the game. Throughout the design and development of the game, I had to think computationally in order to paint the image of what my game must have, this included thinking abstractly, ahead and concurrently etc. Furthermore, creating a Top-Down design was an important factor to developing the game as visually knowing the layout of the game reduces ambiguity during development process, which also links back to computational thinking - Decomposition. Lastly, I have given the user a survey to see if there were any improvements that could have further enhanced the user's experience.
